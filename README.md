# FEMIterate

Very work-in-progress.

**Back-up any files you try this on and save all other documents**.
If the script crashes then it will not change back the parameters to
original ones.

Since this runs on the same thread as the whole FreeCAD GUI, then
it will **freeze** the whole interface. If the entered Python expressions
never finish then you will have to kill FreeCAD.

If it doesn't run because of FEM result is None, then try to run one
simulation yourself using the usual CcxSolver tools.

## Installation

Copy the contents of this repository into your FreeCAD macros directory
(`~/.FreeCAD/Macro` on Linux).

## Usage
